            <p>Rapper sword dancing is a tradition from North East England.  There are teams dancing rapper across the UK, and even Europe and America.  The dance is performed by teams of 5 people  accompanied by a musician and usually a couple of characters, the Tommy and Betty.  It is usually performed around pubs in the local area, though every so often there are national and international competitions.</p>
