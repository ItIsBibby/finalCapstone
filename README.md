# What is Rapper?

This is a website that gives information on a personal hobby, Rapper. It allows a user to mark favourte teams, and leave comments, and uses DOM manipulation to add the updated information to tables.

This was built as a homework task for a web development bootcamp.

## Installation
Copy the files onto your local machine, and open the index.html document in a web browser to be sent to the front page of the website.

## Instructions
The site is split into 5 pages, you can navigate between these pages via the links in the page footer.

The Teams page contains a table of Rapper teams. In the right-hand column of each for of this table there is a "Favourite" button that users can use to toggle whether a team appears on the Favourites page.

The Contact page contains a table of comments relating to teams, which a user can add to using the input boxes. There is also an input box for sending a message to the site, although this currently does not lead anywhere.

## Next steps
It's not the prettiest site, my main priority when creating this was creating an editable table using session storage that manipulates the DOM, so the CSS needs an overhaul.
